One of them is designating alignments of concept instances, which according to the literature are addressed in a handful of publications. Therefore, in this paper we propose a formal framework based on fuzzy logic that can be used to determine such mappings. We provide several similarity functions and a set of inference rules for combining them. The approach has been experimentally verified using widely accepted datasets provided by the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative, yielding promising results."

However, HAR for UAVs is a challenging task due to the motion, attitudes, and view changes of the UAVs during flight. Video sequences captured by UAVs always suffer from blurs and low resolution. All these issues cause difficulty in HAR for UAVs, necessitating the quest for the HAR method that takes into account the characteristics of UAV data. In this paper, we revisit state-of-the-art deep learning methods and evaluate the performance of those methods on the UAV-Human dataset-the largest public UAV dataset up to now. Based on the evaluation, we propose a new framework combining AAGCN and MS-G3D using a Feature Fusion module for data pre-processing in all streams.

As an objective function, the criterion of the maximum probability of successful counteraction of the information security system is proposed for the implementation of all goals by the violator. In contrast to the existing approaches, the MGA proposed in the work and the corresponding target function implement crossover for the case when pairs of parents are selected based on the principle of ""elitism"" of one individual and ""randomness"" of the second. The chromosomes were recorded using real coding.  The сhromosomes were selected based on the strategy that is responsible for the result of crossover. It is shown that the process of finding an optimal solution can be accelerated if a fuzzy logic controller is additionally involved in the structure of the MGA. The practical value of the study lies in the software implementation of the proposed MGA. This made it possible to automate the procedure for analyzing the options for the placement of various information security means for the DCS nodes. With the help of the developed software product, computational experiments were carried out to test the operability of the MGA in the process of determining the probability of successful counteraction to the ISM for the DCS nodes for the implementation of all the tasks of the attacking side. It is indicated that the implementation of the MGA made it possible to accelerate the search for optimal options for placing the ISM for the DCS nodes by 7–15 times."

Although these fore-runners have proposed effective methods, the emotion-to-acoustic diversity limits the advancement. To aim at this issue, in this paper, we present a method to increase the recognition quality by clarifying the diverse relations. In the proposed method, the music is represented by patterns. Next, the emo-tion frequencies and pattern entropies are calculated to show the distribution between concepts and music. Once the distribution is derived, the music emotion can be predicted more successfully. To reveal the effectiveness of proposed method, a comprehensive experiment is conducted and the results show the proposed method is more promising than the state-of-the-arts methods in emotion recognition."

In this paper, we propose FMAR, a novel recommender system which is based on factorization machines and association rules. We introduce an approach to generate association rules using two algorithms: (i) apriori, and (ii) frequent pattern (FP) growth. These association rules will be utilized to reduce the number of items which are passed to factorization machines recommendation model. We show that FMAR has significantly decreased the number of new items that the recommender system has to predict for them, and hence, decreased the required time for generating the recommendations. On the other hand, while building FMAR tool, we concentrate on making a balance between prediction time and accuracy of generated recommendations in order to make sure that the accuracy is not significantly impacted comparing to the accuracy of using factorization machines without association rules."

The versatility and complexity in DBMSs leads the DB researchers towards new philosophy and thoughts. A novel approach is introduced for DB workload management through the characterization and classification approach, scheduling and database idleness detection. In workload characterization, workload is observed and effective workload characterization parameters are selected. After the workload characterization, scheduling is performed in order to arrange the DB workload for reducing the waiting time of each workload. Finally, database idleness is identified at run-time and exploited for system/ user initiated workload to improve efficiency. The proposed approach for workload management is validated through experiments by taking the benchmark workloads.

Because of that, to improve the initialization of autoencoders for the spectral unmixing task, we propose to use the pre-training scheme consisting of clustering-based artificial labeling. We test the approach on two popular hyperspectral datasets, i.e. Samson and Jasper Ridge. Our experiment provides promising results, improving autoencoders effectiveness in the case of the Samson dataset. The worse results in the case of Jasper Ridge datasets show that more research is required to understand when the proposed approach improves the results of the spectral unmixing. The auxiliary experiments, which we also conduct, allow us to partly answer that question."

Accumulating evidence suggests that some common germline gene variants in the population may influence the disease course and treatment response in various cancers, including NSCLC. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the prognostic potential of variants in genes encoding proteins implicated in cancer progression and therapy resistance in NSCLC patients receiving radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy. The association between selected polymorphisms and survival endpoints was assessed using univariate and multivariate models incorporating clinical, lifestyle and demographic risk factors. The analysis in the curative treatment subgroup identified two genetic variants related to overall survival and risk of recurrence. The final models revealed that these variants were predictors of recurrence and survival independent of strong clinical and lifestyle parameters. Our preliminary results emphasize the role of selected host-related genetic factors as potential prognostic biomarkers in lung cancer."

In recent years, the success of deep convolutional neural networks and the popularity of low-cost consumer wearable cameras have made hand pose estimation on egocentric images using deep neural networks a hot topic in the computer vision field. This paper proposes a novel deep model for accurate 2D hand pose estimation that combines HOPE-Net, which estimates hand pose, and Mask R-CNN, which provides a hand detection and segmentation to localize the hand in the image. First, HOPE-Net is used to predict the initial 2D hand pose, and the hand features are extracted from an image with hand in the center, which is cropped from the original image based on Mask-RCNN's output. Then, we combine the initial 2D hand pose and the hand features to a fully connected layer for predicting correctly 2D hand pose. Our experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the original HOPE-Net in 2D hand pose estimation. The proposed method's mean endpoint error (mEPE) is 48.82 pixels, while the mEPE of 2D HOPE-Net predictor is 86.30 pixels on the First-Person Hand Action dataset."

Background: There is consensus in the literature that marketable banking is itself a stress generator for those who do. In addition to the pressure to achieve ambitious, often unattainable commercial goals, or the changes due to ongoing adjustments in the industry, there is also stress in the current context, which in many cases leads to burnout situations within the CBT.
Methods: This work was done as a case study. A total of 32 bankers took part in this study by answering questionnaires. The ages of the contributors ranged from 27 to 58 years old (mean age 40.5 years old), with 41% women and 59% men. The questionnaire consists of two sections, the first containing general questions (e.g., age, gender, academic qualifications, seniority), while the second section presents information on dimensions such as Stress Level, Exhaustion, Cynicism and Professional Effectiveness that are compatible with the objectives of this work.
Results: Mathematical-logical programs are presented to measure the extent of stress and possible burnout in the commercial banking team by assessing the entropic status. Based on the BEST8 tool for measuring the stress level of commercial employees, its influence on the development of the burnout state was assessed by the Maslach Burnout Inventory – General Survey (MBI – GS) and thus its three dimensions of exhaustion, cynicism and professional effectiveness with regard to their best and worst-case scenarios.
Conclusions: The perception that the entropic state conveyed by each member of the CBT) is relevant for adequate personnel management of the CBT in order to reduce the risk of stress and burnout. This work shows that it is possible to predict trends to enable both preventive and corrective action, set more realistic financial budget goals, reduce workload, promote measures to strengthen social support between employees and supervisors developing strategies to generate positive feedback, step up to reduce this risk."

The proposed framework considers tweets that mention the cryptocurrency ""Dogecoin"" and analyses the textual content of each of these tweets using a modified version of the lexicon-based sentiment polarity analysis method, VADER. The generated, Twitter sentiment time series is then compared to a time series of the closing prices of Dogecoin for each day. Granger causality analysis showed a unidirectional relationship between Twitter sentiment and cryptocurrency prices for day lags ranging from 2 to 4 days (with a 3-day lag having the lowest statistical significance value). This was also accompanied by a Pearson correlation coefficient of \(r = 0.6940\) and a clear visual correlation between the two time series (with this 3-day lag). Findings indicate that Twitter sentiment is directly correlated and can be predictive of the future prices of cryptocurrencies."

However, extracting and analysing this data can prove to be very challenging due to its diversity and complexity. Recent methods of sentiment analysis of social media content rely on Natural Language Processing techniques on a fundamental sentiment lexicon, as well as machine learning oriented techniques. In this work, we evaluate representatives of different sentiment analysis methods, make recommendations and discuss advantages and disadvantages.

This information is relevant not only to assess a patient’s prognosis but also to guide the first-line treatment. Here, we applied clinical data from over 400 patients to predict time to metastatic relapse which is also called metastasis-free survival (MFS). Using Cox regression, we have got a fairly good prediction with c-index =0.63 for a model with three clinical covariates. In addition, we created also a nomogram that could be applied for predicting the probability of metastases in newly diagnosed patients.

Therefore, CNN can be used for classification purposes. Automated tumor detection through MRI has become very informative as it provides information about abnormal tissues. This information becomes a necessity for planning treatment.

Accordingly, we propose a Hyperledger-based approach to illustrate how blockchain technology can be applied for the reduction of information asymmetries on the used car market. In Hyperledger Fabric, all business network transactions are recorded on the smart contracts, allowing the records to coexist among the participants, which include dealers, maintenance plant, motor vehicle office, police office, and buyer.  We also discuss how our proposed Hyperledger application can mitigate information asymmetries between buyers and sellers, guarantee the integrity and transparency of data, and shorten the time obtaining car historical information."

In this article, we derive a general investing schema considering the signal generation based on the well-known classification methods and verify the quality of these signals with the idea of portfolio building. To do so, we derive a two-stage process, where the first stage is devoted to deriving the classifier capable of generating the trading signals on the forex market. We use the set of the most popular market indicators, and the decision about the potential buy (or sell) signal is dependent on the values of these indicators. Eventually, we derive the classifier in which quality is measured on the basis of accuracy, recall, and precision. Further, we use signals generated by the classifier to adjust the account balance of the decision-maker and estimate the relation between the quality of classification and the final account balance.

This time we wanted to confirm our results using public and independently created video sources and for this purpose we chose the Affectiva-MIT Facial Expression Dataset (AM-FED). Our purpose was to find out whether we can estimate Happiness through non-linear dynamics of EM also in independent video data. We have calculated EM chaotic dynamics in video recordings of the AM-FED database and performed estimations of Happiness calculated with parameters provided by the Open Face library (OF). We also calculated correlation between these parameters and parameters attached to the AM-FED database using our own method based on sliding windows and proposed a method of using its output parameter with a short algorithm. We have observed that true Happiness was connected to a moderate value of negative correlation with EM chaotic dynamics in the case when smile was not present, while for declarative “Smile” parameters  we observed a moderate positive value. By using EM chaotic dynamics correlation we have estimated the difference between posed smiles and true Happiness with the XGBoost classifier, with accuracy results of 0.75 (ROC-AUC 0.9) and precision of 0.8 (tested with dataset of 0.33). We are proposing EM chaotic dynamics parameters as an extension for estimations of Happiness based only on facial muscles activity. We think that this approach can confirm the authenticity of Happiness in various cases and also introduce the distinction between real and declarative FE into Computer Vision. It also can bring solution in cases when lower part of the face is hidden, i.e. when is covered by a protective mask."

It is mostly based on the extensively developed image recognition algorithm using convolutional neural networks(CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Action recognition is considered as a more challenging task than image recognition as a video consists of an image sequence that changes in every frame, and the model has to deal with both spatial and temporal information simultaneously. Recently proposed methods using the two-stream fusion technique show good performance in such tasks. However, these methods are computationally expensive and are complex to build for learning spatio-temporal dependencies of the action. This paper proposes a simple yet efficient deep neural network architecture, Gated 3D-CNN, consisting of 3D convolutional layers and gating modules to act as an LSTM model for learning spatial and temporal dependencies and give attention to essential features. The proposed method first learns spatial and temporal features of actions through 3D-CNN. Then, the sigmoid gated 3D convolution layers of local and global gating help to locate attention to the essential features of the action. The proposed architecture is comparatively simpler to implement and gives a competitive performance on the UFC-101 dataset.

However, in many cases users may also read news that are not in their usual interest, for example breaking news. Such a news often has global characteristics that are independent of specific users. In this paper, we propose a neural news recommendation method that combine user specific news models with global news models to better deal with those situations. To create informative news models, we adopt an attentive neural approach

In road traffic monitoring, background subtraction is a critical approach where moving objects are extracted via facilitating motion information of interest to static surroundings, known as backgrounds. To work with various contextual dynamics of nature scenes, supervised models of background subtraction aim to solve a gradient-based optimization problem on multimodal sequences of videos by training a convolutional neural network. As video datasets are scaling up, distributing the model learning on multiple processing elements is a pivotal technique to leverage the computational power among various devices. However, decades of ongoing research have shown that communication overhead is emerging as a severe bottleneck in distributed machine learning. The exchange of local parameters among workers in each training iteration may cause a prodigality when messages are unnecessarily communicated among processing units.

This paper introduces a new framework of distributed training for background subtraction to alleviate the communication overhead in distributed training with video data. The new framework utilizes event-triggered communication on a ring topology among workers and UPC++, a high-performance communication framework for asynchronous computation. Through the framework, we aim to investigate how training a background subtraction tolerates the trade-offs between communication avoidance and accurate generalization in model learning. The experimental results of communication reduction in the proposed framework examined on the CDnet-2014 dataset show that the framework can reduce the communication overhead by at least 94.71% while having a negligible reduction in accuracy (at most 2.68%).

In the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL we combine functional programming and logical program verification to build a theorem prover for propositional logic. Finally, we consider how such a prover can be used to solve a reasoning task without much mental labor."

One of the key challenges related to development of such solu-tions is the proper assessment of methods utilized in the process of anomaly de-tection. Real life cases show that in many situations labeled network data is not available, which effectively excludes possibility to utilized standard criteria for evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms like Receiver Operating Characteris-tic or Precision-Recall curves. In this paper, an alternative criteria based on Ex-cess-Mass and Mass-Volume curves are analyzed, which can enable anomaly detection algorithms quality assessments without need for labeled datasets. This paper focuses on the assessment of effectiveness of Excess-Mass and Mass-Volume curves based criteria in relation to intrusion detection system’s data di-mensionality. The article discusses these criteria and presents the intrusion de-tection algorithms and datasets that will be utilized in the analysis of data di-mensionality influence on their effectiveness. This discussion is followed by experimental verification of these criteria on various real-life datasets differing in dimensionality and statistical analysis of the results indicating relation be-tween effectiveness of analyzed criteria and dimensionality of data processed in intrusion detection systems."

First, we model the user preference gap (uPG) as the distance between two timeseries, representing the user's consumption per content categories. Second, we map the uPG score onto the not-yet-rated items, and consider two approaches to minimize uPG per user, when they go beyond a certain threshold. In particular, we propose post and pre-constrained versions of the alternating least square algorithm that reduce the user's uPG score, hence avoiding to reinforce her polarization over time. Interestingly, these newly constrained algorithms still maintain a high level of recommendation accuracy. Our simulation results, derived from real datasets, show that our solutions enable personalization with a reasonable level of polarization."

However, the problem of these is that users usually don’t move regularly thru all the areas, which leads to undersampling on certain parts of the localization area. In this paper interpolation algorithms are used to increase radio map density and thus reduce the problem with under-sampling. To evaluate the impact of interpolation on the performance of fingerprinting algorithms the NN, KNN and WKNN algorithms were tested on dynamic radio map without interpolation as well as with radio maps created using linear, inverse distance weight and Kriging interpolations. The paper shows the results achieved in the real-world scenario and shows the impact of the interpolation algorithms on the performance of the above-mentioned localization algorithms."

In this study, we proposed to apply dynamic movement primitives algorithm (DMP) combined with differential evolution (DE) optimization algorithm with an improvement in the search space to solve this problem of the human upper limb.

A worker can earn the utility associated with the job if (s)he performs this. As the jobs are originating at different POIs, the worker has to move from one POI to the other one to take up the job. Some budget is available for this purpose. Any two jobs can be taken up by the worker only if the finishing time of the first job plus traveling time from the POI of the first job to the second one should be less than or equal to the starting time of the second job. We call this constraint as the temporal constraint. The goal of this problem is to choose a subset of the
jobs to maximize the earned utility such that the budget and temporal constraints should not be violated. We present two solution approaches with detailed analysis. First one of them works based on finding the locally optimal job at the end of every job and we call this approach as the Best First Search Approach. The other approach is based on the Nearest Neighbor Search on road networks. We perform a set of experiments with real-world trajectory datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and

Determining the confidence interval in the key space allows you to repeatedly reduce the number of integrations, and allows you to enter the estimated characteristics of the strength level of a cryptographic cipher. The resulting algorithm allows us to create a new original testing methodology for assessing the durability of asymmetric algorithms. The main object of the study of the characteristics of the cipher text is the determination of patterns in the control sample. The task of optimizing the key space, in terms of visualization, is aimed at identifying the unambiguous value of the key. The RSA asymmetric cipher was chosen as the cryptographic cipher under study. This article analyzes the cryptographic cipher using geometric interpretation of encrypted control messages. A software implementation has been developed for data analysis: visualization of cipher texts was performed using the matplotlib library in the Python programming language. As a general aggregate, data were used under the conditions: e = 3, as well as other values; large values of the module, with the results obtained during more than 1000 experiments. The article also shows the visualization of a cipher text in which visualization is detected with an incorrectly selected module - which does not satisfy the condition for generating RSA keys: GFC(e,φ(n))≠1, (φ(n))/2+1=e.

This paper proposes a novel approach to select a sub-optimal feature combination automatically. Our proposed method is model-agnostic that can be integrated with any prediction model. The basic idea is to use a Genetic Algorithm to discover a near-optimal feature combination; the fitness of a solution is calculated based on the accuracy obtained from the prediction model. In addition, to reduce the time complexity, we introduce a strategy to generate training data used in the fitness calculation. The proposed strategy aims to satisfy at the same time two objectives: minimizing the amount of training data, thereby saving the model’s training time, and ensuring the diversity of the data to guarantee the prediction accuracy. The experimental results show that our proposed GA-based feature selection method can improve the prediction accuracy by an average of 28.32% compared to other existing approaches. Moreover, by using the proposed training data generation strategy we can shorten the time complexity by 25.67% to 85.34%, while the prediction accuracy is degraded by only 2.97% on average."

The forward translation is utilized to translate the monolingual data into the target language. The experimental part focuses on the formation of the English – Russian – Kazakh three banks by translating 500 thousand Russian sentences into 500 thousand Kazakh sentences from the English – Russian dataset and 101622 Kazakh sentences into 101622 Russian sentences from the English – Kazakh dataset with the trained machine translation model and translation platforms such as Google, Yandex and Prompt. The obtained three bank corpora are very meaningful for extending the available resources of the Kazakh language and other applied tasks in the natural language processing field."

The DES algorithm was also investigated in the same block cipher modes of operation to compare the characteristic features on the ciphertext, as well as to compare and evaluate the robustness of the ci-phers, using the methodology of periodic regularities.
The article applies a characterization method, to investigate the features of the four block cipher modes, which includes two analytical principles: the first principle, which identifies periodicity with respect to the ciphertext; and the second, which includes the principle of repeated iterations encryption, for reactions of characteristic manifestations of the ciphertext, at certain control input data. Visual-ization technologies implemented in the Python programming language are used to analyze the behavioral characteristics of cryptographic ciphers. Graphical visualizations of both algorithms on all modes investigated are shown, and appropriate analysis of ciphertext regularities and relative changing blocks; and relative changing iterations of a single ciphertext are performed and reflected in the result-ing corresponding formulas."

However, fusing different descriptors is not always easy, notably because of their different types (local vs. global, dense vs. sparse $\ldots$) and the heterogeneity of the generated features. In this work, we propose to use genetic programming to generate and fuse two different texture classifiers based respectively on HOG and uniform LBP descriptors. Indeed, the proposed method includes a late fusion and data augmentation process in order to combine the classifier's results while using small set of training data. The suggested method benefits from the different information captured by both descriptors while being robust to rotation changes. The performance of the proposed method has been validated on four challenging datasets including different variations.

This allows an automatic interpretation of the resulting hierarchies while differentiating between clusters of different magnitudes, or those that extend significantly through one pair of dimensions while being coherent in a different one. On the basis of the resulting modifications, it is possible to analyse the depth level as a function of likelihood.

We demonstrate that the proposed approach is highly effective and it outperforms well-established transfer learning strategies, thus improving the potential of existing pre-trained deep models.

In order to eliminate those constraints, non-parametric classifiers based on new machine learning methods have been introduced. In our research, we aim to create land use classification using support vector machine (SVM), one of the most popular non-parametric classifiers in Nanjing, China, by TM images of Landsat 8 satellite. We also compared different kernels in SVM and applied cross validation to determine how the parameters optimization can affect the accuracy in SVM. To assess its improvement in accuracy based on parametric classifiers, we also introduced two of the most popular parametric classifiers: maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and minimum distance classifier (MDC). The accuracy assessment includes both training and test set addressing the problem of overfitting and uderfitting. The results confirm that SVM classifier has higher overall accuracy, less time complexity and kappa coefficient as compared to MLC and MDC especially on test set. "

In addition, demand for higher accuracy models is increasing continuously at the same rates as the growth of other fields of science. Using all DL tools in the de-velopment of computer vision (CV) is a fundamental aspect of its future devel-opment.  Considering all such tools, we conducted research on the effect of data representation on the final classification accuracy and proposed image pixels’ double representation (IPDR) and image pixels’ multiple representations (IPMR) for skipping certain pixels in the images in a dataset. Because the image pixel val-ues range from 0 to 255, we proposed including all knowledge from different in-tervals of pixels. With IPDR, we trained the model using a dataset and obtained the prediction probabilities for the classification task. Next, we created two differ-ent datasets from an existing dataset. The first dataset took only image pixels of higher than 127, with all other image pixels in the dataset changed to zeros. The second dataset took only image pixels equal to or lower than 127. These two cre-ated datasets were trained on the same model architecture and their prediction ac-curacies for classification were ensembled with the prediction accuracies of the main model. With the IPMR method, we applied the same method as previously described, although instead of two intervals, from 0 to 127, and 127 to 255, we used, multiple intervals of 50 (i.e., [0:50], (50:100], (100:150], (150:200], and (200:255]) for the Cifar10 dataset.

Then we apply Support Vector Machine (SVM) Machine Learning (ML) technique to classify emails according to whether they contain a signature. To improve obtained results we apply a set of sophisticated Information Extraction (IE) rules. Finally, we extract signatures with a great success.

In short-range C-V2X, two techniques for resource allocation are defined: one that is network-controlled named Mode 3, and another that is entirely distributed among nodes, named Mode 4. 3GPP defines a Mode 4 algorithm due to its critical necessity and enables interoperability between products from different suppliers. Outside of 3GPP, few studies have been conducted to determine the performance of the standard and the effect of its many parameters. Previous work stated that the C-V2X performance for very slow vehicles speed depends on the number of vehicles and the value of resource keep probability. The primary contribution of this work is to investigate the performance of C-V2X Mode 4 in realistic highway scenarios by altering the vehicle's speed, vehicle density, resource keep probability, and MCS parameters. The simulation scenarios in previous work still use a similar vehicle's speed of 20 km/h.

The mechanical properties of ferrous metal alloys on an iron-manganese basis practically reach very large values and they can be used in various branches of engineering and industry. The hardening of many alloys is achieved by the additional contribution of interfacial boundaries. On the other hand, these boundaries may be places of preferred fracture (intergranular fracture) or deformation. By changing the number and structure of interphase boundaries, the shape and spatial arrangement of individual structural components of multiphase systems (polycrystals, heterophase aggregates resulting from phase transformations, or artificially obtained compositions), as well as by adjusting the composition and defective structure of individual crystals, it is possible to obtain a huge variety of mechanical properties necessary for the practical use of metallic materials.

With this structural information, GNNs can help to retain more information from the original graph than conventional embeddings like TransE, TransH, RESCAL. As a result, the learning model achieves higher accuracy in predicting missing links between entities in the KG. Meanwhile, several studies have successfully demonstrated the intrinsic properties of the embedding process in complex space while keeping many binary relations (symmetric and asymmetric). Thus, this paper proposes deploying GNNs into complex space to increase the model's predictive capability. Another issue with GNNs is that they are susceptible to over-squashing when a large amount of information propagating between nodes is compressed down to a fixed representation space. As a result, we utilize a dynamic attention mechanism to minimize the adverse effects of these factors, and experiments on benchmark datasets have indicated that our proposal achieves a significant improvement compared to baseline models on almost all standard metrics."

The interactions are represented by contextual embeddings (neural language models) and the observations are collected from various occurrence contexts of both the whole MWEs and their single word components.
Our method uses a MWE lexicon as the sole knowledge base, and extracts training samples by matching the lexicon against a corpus to build classifiers for MWE recognition by Machine Learning. Thus, our approach does not require a corpus annotated with MWE occurrences, and also works with a limited corpus and a MWE list ($\approx1400$ MWEs in this work).

Graphs are used in various applications and to model real world objects. 
To understand the underlying characteristics of large graphs, graph summarization becomes a hot topic aiming to facilitate the identification of structure and meaning in data. The problem of graph summarization has been studied in the literature and many approaches for static contexts are proposed to summarize the graph in terms of its communities. These approaches typically produce groupings of nodes which satisfy or approximate some optimization function. Nevertheless, they fail to characterize the subgraphs and do not summarize both the structure and the content in the same approach. Existing approaches are only suitable for a static context, and do not offer direct dynamic counterparts. This means that there is no framework that provides summarization of mixed-source and information with the goal of creating a dynamic, syntactic, and semantic data summary. 
In this paper, we address the aforementioned problems by proposing an appropriate approach able to model heterogoneous sources based in a single graph based on a schema-driven approach, providing a personalized summary model capable of synthesize graphically the content based and finally summarizing the structure of the graph in order to reduce its size and minimize its complexity and keep the important nodes and relations.We illustrate this approach through a case study on the use of E-health domain."

The leading solution for this problem is based on graph embedding. Recently, in embedding approaches, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have produced promising results, especially the HypER model. The HypER model outperforms the preceding approaches to maximize the quantity of information from the source entities and relations. However, HypER and other CNN-based methods only focus on retaining information (i.e., structure) of knowledge graphs in low dimension embedding spaces while ignoring literals of the entities. However, the literals can also have a significant impact on relation construction. As a result, this paper proposes an improved model called HypERLit, which is based on the HypER model and incorporates literals. Experiments prove that the role of literals significantly influences the accuracy of the prediction model on the benchmark datasets, including FB15k, FB15k-237, and YAGO3-10. Furthermore, our model outperforms the HypER and other CNN-based models on almost standard metrics."

In SAKE, we apply semantic to the phrases and incorporates the semantic to the ranking process. Technically, a document is represented as a graph, in which vertices are words and edges are relations among words. In each doc-ument, we get a representative thematic vector by computing the average of word embedding vectors. Each vertex has a similarity score to the thematic vector and this score will be involved to the scoring in the ranking process. The important vertices are highly weighted not only by their relationships to other vertices but also by the similarity to the document theme.

despite the introduction of various mask detectors over the last two years, most of them were constructed following the two-stage approach and are inappropriate for usage in real-time applications The second gap is how the currently available datasets could not support the detectors in identifying correct, incorrect and no mask-wearing efficiently without the need for data pre-processing. The third and final gap concerns the costly expenses required as the other detector models were embedded into microcomputers such as Arduino and Raspberry Pi. In this paper, we will first propose a modified YOLO-based model that was explicitly designed to resolve the real-time face mask detection problem; during the process, we have updated the collected datasets and thus will also make them publicly available so that other similar experiments could benefit from; lastly, the proposed model is then implemented onto our custom web application for real-time face mask detection.

Such an approach leads to the removal of important information from the classification process and therefore to the lower value of each experiment for the determination of the gradient when trying to optimise hyperparameters. We propose aggregated performance measures that can be thought of as an analogue of classical ones.

	In this work we utilize multiple -omics datasets in order to assess their useful-ness for predicting 2 year survival of lung adenocarcinoma using clinical data of 267 patients. By utilizing mRNA and microRNA expression levels, positions of somatic mutations, changes in the DNA copy number and DNA methylation levels we developed multiple single and multiple omics-based classifiers. We also tested various data aggregation and feature selection techniques, showing their influence on the classification accuracy manifested by the area under ROC curve (AUC).
The results of our study show not only that molecular data can be effectively used to predict 2 year survival in lung adenocarcinoma (AUC=0.85), but also that information on gene expression changes, methylation and mutations provides much better predictors than CNV and data from microRNA studies. We were also able to show the classification performance obtained using different dimensionality reduction methods on the most problematic CNV dataset, con-cluding that gene and gene set aggregation provides the best classification results.

Our method called CCRAL combines causal reasoning to learn counterfactual samples for the original training samples and active learning to select useful counterfactual samples based on a region of uncertainty. By doing this, our method can maximize our model's generalization on the unseen testing data. We validate our method analytically, and compare with the standard baselines. Our experimental results highlight that CCRAL achieves significantly better performance than those of the baselines across several real-world tabular datasets in terms of accuracy and AUC."

One cannot ignore the importance of the knowledge that exists in very large columnar temporal databases. It is because real-world big data is widely stored in columnar temporal databases. With this motivation, this paper proposes an efficient algorithm, Partial Periodic Pattern-Equivalence CLass Transformation (3P-ECLAT), to find desired patterns in a columnar temporal database. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world databases demonstrate that 3P-ECLAT is not only memory and runtime efficient but also highly scalable. Finally, we present the usefulness of 3P-ECLAT with a case study on air pollution analytics."

Since some UGC content are indistinguishable from professional content, we are not interested so much in all UGC content, but only in the quality that clearly differs from the professional. For such content, we use the term ``in-the-wild'' as a closely related concept to the concept of UGC, which is its special case. In this paper, we show that it is possible to deliver the new concept of an objective ``in-the-wild'' video content recognition model. The value of the F-measure of our model is 0.988. The resulting model is trained and tested in video sequence databases containing professional  and ``in-the-wild'' content.

However, ITN is a highly language-dependent task that is especially tricky in ambiguous languages. In this study, we focus on improving the performance of ITN tasks by adopting the combination of neural network models and rule-based systems. Specifically, we first use a seq2seq model to detect numerical segments (e.g., cardinals, ordinals, and date) of input sentences. Then, detected segments are converted into written-form using rule-based systems. Technically, a major difference in our method is that we use neural networks to learn the detected segments only, which is able to deal with the low resource and ambiguous scenarios of target languages. Regarding the experiment, we evaluate different languages in order to indicate the advantages of the proposed method. Accordingly, empirical evaluations provide promising results of our method compared with state-of-the-art models in this research field, especially in the case of low resource scenarios.   "

To contend with these difficulties, this paper proposes a parallel algorithm named P-FCloHUS for fast mining FCHU sequences by making good use of multi-core processors. By relying on a novel Single scan synchronization strategy that is facilitated by an efficiently Partitioned result space structure, P-FCloHUS successfully alleviates the communication cost between mining tasks and hence speeds up the parallel mining process.

However, the training required to become a competent cataract surgeon takes years due to its challenging technical nature. This limits the supply of capable surgeons. One aspect of modern cataract surgery is that video recordings are routinely taken using microscope cameras,
and these recordings can be used to review errors and improve technique throughout surgical training.
However, reviewing raw surgery video footage is tedious and may not lead to actionable insights improving surgeon performance. To tackle this issue, a novel artificial intelligence (AI)-based framework for the extraction of detailed surgery video summary statistics directly from the raw surgery footage is proposed. The input to the system is a video of a cataract surgery procedures and the output is a summary report. The approach uses deep learning models (ResNet-50, ResNet-152 and InceptionV3 were tested) to identify and time surgical instrument activity. Additionally, a unique dataset consisting of 57,422 hand-labelled frames extracted from a new locally-sourced video dataset of 29 retrospective cataract surgery recordings was created. Testing these predictive models with 4-fold cross validation across ten different surgical instruments resulted in a best mean testing prediction area under the ROC curve of 97.6%, and a mean testing sensitivity of 96.6%. Given these high levels of accuracy, the reports generated by our system are high quality and could be used to provide actionable insight into surgical technique during surgical training."

The months of January, March, November and December have been identified 76, 79, 77 and 80 times as drought months respectively in the 20th century, indicating that these months must be provided with assured Irrigation. It is observed that 1904, 1911, 1915, 1923, 1974, 1987 and 2002 affected by severe drought condition in SPEI-12. The China Z Index and Modified China Z index shows that’s 1904, 1911, 1915, 1918, 1923, 1948, 1951, 1965, 1968, 1969, 1972, 1974, 1985, 1987, 1991, 1995 and 2002 affected by extreme drought. The study also reveals that only 1% year obtain as extreme wet conditions. From result it shows that 23% years are categorized into moderate to extreme drought years, which includes 15% Moderate dry, 8% severe dry years. "

However, WGAN-based models are designed to work mainly on continuous data and cannot capture the diverse set of patterns in a URL sequence.
In order to overcome this issue, we propose En-SeqGAN which works on discrete data to generate full URL sequences. 
The proposed model is based on the standard SeqGAN with the addition of entropy regularization to encourage the model to produce diverse URL samples. 
Several intensive experiments are done to prove that the URL samples generated by the proposed model can evade the gray-box phishing detectors of LSTM and Random Forest. The efficiency of gray-box attack by En-SeqGAN on these URL classifiers outperforms both methods of SeqGAN and WGAN.
Moreover, En-SeqGAN can generate well-structured URL samples with various URL sequence lengths."

In this study, we proposed to apply dynamic movement primitives algorithm (DMP) combined with differential evolution (DE) optimization algorithm with an improvement in the search space to solve this problem of the human upper limb. This E-HMCS device used to measure the endpoint trajectories of Activities of Daily Liv-ing. DMP algorithm helps to generate trajectories like those measured. The new trajectories were then put into the proposed optimization algorithm to solve the inverse kinematics to create a set of predicted joint values. The comparison results showed that new trajectories and predict values of the joints have the same form as the measured trajectory and angle values. This demonstrates the possibility of using the proposed algorithms to generate new trajectories to solve the problem of inverse kinematics of natural movements of human upper limbs."

In this paper, we suggest a novel recommender system based on Factorization Machines and Association Rules (FMAR). We introduce an approach to generate association rules using two algorithms: (i) apriori and (ii) frequent pattern (FP) growth. These association rules will be utilized to reduce the number of items passed to the factorization machines recommendation model. We show that FMAR has significantly decreased the number of new items that the recommender system has to predict and hence, decreased the required time for generating the recommendations. On the other hand, while building the FMAR tool, we concentrate on making a balance between prediction time and accuracy of generated recommendations to ensure that the accuracy is not significantly impacted compared to the accuracy of using factorization machines without association rules."

However, not all data is hierarchical. We also found that most of the geometry models were trained to attain good results on high-dimensional embeddings and low-dimensional embeddings are often of little interest. Besides, neural networks and graph networks models have had an impressive performance. However, they also require a relatively high-dimensional embedding to achieve good results, making them limited to use in large-scale KGs. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce a new model named MuREL (Multi-Relational Euclidean Lorentzian), which learns a mixed embedding between two spaces, Euclidean and Lorentzian. They are not only suitable for a variety of data types but also work well on low-dimensional embeddings. Experiments on standard benchmark datasets from the task of link prediction show that our model outperforms existing Euclidean and Hyperbolic models, especially at lower dimensionality."

Each epoch during training represents a different prediction space, which is the key to the development of the proposed method. We used the top-three prediction probabilities of each image for the classification task from different epochs of training and ensembled them into the best model prediction probabilities. Applying our method, we partially solved the ensemble error problem in the models and increased the accuracy of our model from 89.32% to 90.91%.

The ConvE model is the first work using 2D convolution over embeddings and stacking multiple nonlinear feature layers to model knowledge graphs. However, its computation is inefficient and does not preserve translation between entity and relation embedding. Therefore, dynamic convolution was designed to solve limited representation capability issues and show the promised performance. This work introduces a mixture model that incorporates attention into performing the convolutional operation on projection embeddings. The TransD idea is used to project entity embedding from entity space to relation space. Then, it is stacked with relation embedding to perform dynamic convolution over stacked embedding without reshaping, following the idea that comes from Conv-TransE. So the translational property between the entity and the relation is preserved, and their diversity is considered.

Unfortunately, researchers indicate that most people do not wear masks correctly, with their nose, mouth, or chin uncovered. This issue makes masks a useless tool against the virus. Recent studies have attempted to use deep learning technology to recognize wrong mask usage behavior. However, current solutions either cover only the mask/non-mask classification problem or require heavy computational resources that cannot be deployed in a computational-limited system. To fill the gap in current research, we focus on constructing a deep learning model that achieves high-performance results with low processing time. Then, a correct face mask usage detection framework was proposed. The Raspberry Pi, a low-cost, credit-card-sized computer, and Raspberry Pi camera were deployed to implement our proposed framework.

The statement condition is the distribution of the cipher text as a normally distributed random variable. Determining the confidence interval in the key space allows you to repeatedly reduce the number of integrations, and allows you to enter the estimated characteristics of the strength level of a cryptographic cipher. The resulting algorithm allows us to create a new original testing methodology for assessing the durability of asymmetric algorithms. The main object of the study of the characteristics of the cipher text is the determination of patterns in the control sample. The task of optimizing the key space, in terms of visualization, is aimed at identifying the unambiguous value of the key. The RSA asymmetric cipher was chosen as the cryptographic cipher under study. This article analyzes the cryptographic cipher using geometric interpretation of encrypted control messages. A software implementation has been developed for data analysis: visualization of cipher texts was performed using the matplotlib library in the Python programming language. As a general aggregate, data were used under the conditions: e = 3, as well as other values; large values of the module, with the results obtained during more than 1000 experiments. The article also shows the visualization of a cipher text in which visualization is detected with an incorrectly selected module - which does not satisfy the condition for generating RSA keys: GFC(e,φ(n))≠1, (φ(n))/2+1=e. An efficiency table is presented, which gives a reduction in possible iterations when using a confidence interval in the key space."

However, at the beginning of the pandemic, there were not very large databases of Sars-CoV-2 positive patient images on which a network could perform learning.
A solution to this problem could be a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) algorithm to create new synthetic data indistinguishable from the real data using the available data set. It would allow training a network capable of performing classification with greater accuracy on a larger and more diverse number of training data. Obtaining such a tool could allow for more efficient research on how to solve the global COVID-19 pandemic problem.

Background – The consensus is that MB is a stress generator for those who do it. In addition to the pressure to achieve ambitious, often unattainable commercial goals, or the changes due to ongoing adjustments in the industry, in many cases leads to stress situations within the MB. On the other hand, the literature on stress in the banking industry is vast. Undeniably, it is a well-known fact that the banking industry is one of the most stressful industries to work in. Indeed, the literature on stress in the banking industry has been studied for decades and there are many different perspectives on what causes stress and how it can be managed.
Conclusions – The perception that the entropic state conveyed by each member of the MB is relevant for adequate personnel management of the MB in order to reduce the risk of stress and burnout. This work shows that it is possible to predict trends to enable both preventive and corrective action, set more realistic financial budget goals, reduce workload, promote measures to strengthen social support between employees and supervisors developing strategies to generate positive feedback, step up to reduce this risk."

RIMONEv2 and REFUGE, both public labelled glaucoma detection datasets that capture fundus camera device information, were included for analysis. Features were extracted from images using the ResNet101V2 ImageNet-pretrained neural network and classified using a random forest classifier to detect glaucoma. The experiment was conducted using all possible combinations of training and testing camera devices. Images were preprocessed in six different ways using either single or combination of three different preprocessing methods to see their effect on generalisation. In each combination, images were preprocessed using median filtering, input standardisation and multi-image histogram matching. Standardisation of images led to greater accuracy than other two methods in most of the scenarios with an average of 0.85 area under the receiver operator characteristic curve. However, in certain situations, specific combinations of preprocessing techniques lead to significant improvements in accuracy compared to standardisation. The experimental results indicate that our proposed combination of preprocessing method can aid domain generalisation and improve glaucoma detection in the context of different and unseen retinal fundus camera devices."

However, there are different ways to write down the address information in Vietnam.

First, we create a dataset of real estate advertisements having 16 different attributes (entities) of each real estate and assign the correct label for each entity detected during the data annotation process. Then, we propose a practical approach for detecting locations of possible addresses inside one specific real estate advertisement post and then extract the localized address text into four different levels of the address information: City/Province, District/Town, Ward, and Street. Finally, we compare our proposed method with other approaches and achieve the highest accuracy results for all levels as follows: City/Province (95.20%), District/Town (94.82%), Ward (92.25%), Street (89.94%), and the combined accuracy of correctly detecting all four levels is 83.67%."

To collect a set of complete sequential patterns with the stricter weighted constrains of sequential patterns, the proposed algorithm uses both the minimum support constraint and the actual values of items appearing in the sequence database. To increase the performance of the finding weighted sequential patterns process, the algorithm uses the parent–child relationship on the prefix tree structure to create candidates and combines the weighted mean of the sequential 1-patterns that calculated from the actual value of items in the sequence database as conditions to find the weighted sequential patterns.

Phishers seek new vulnerabilities with every advance in fraud prevention and have become an even more pressing issue of security challenges for banks and financial institutions. However, researchers have focused mainly on the prevention of fraudulent transactions on the online banking system. This paper proposes a new anti-phishing model for mobile banking systems at the transaction level (AntiPhiMBS-TRN) that mitigates fraudulent transactions in the mobile banking payment system. This model applies a unique id for the transactions and an application id for the bank application known to the bank, bank application, users, and the mobile banking system. In addition, AntiPhiMBS-TRN also utilizes the international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) number of the registered mobile device to prevent fraudulent transactions. Phishers cannot execute fraudulent transactions without knowing the unique id for the transaction, application id, and IMEI number of the mobile device. This paper employs a process meta language (PROMELA) to specify system descriptions and security properties and builds a verification model of AntiPhiMBS-TRN. Finally, AntiPhiMBS-TRN is successfully verified using a simple PROMELA interpreter (SPIN). The SPIN verification results prove that the proposed AntiPhiMBS-TRN is error-free, and banks can implement the verified model for mitigating fraudulent transactions in the mobile banking system globally."

Two experiments were planned. In both experiments, models had to classify three emotions based on EEG data: positive, negative and neutral. In the first one, a classifier was trained on data from every person in a group and then tested on the data from the same group of people. In the second test, a classifier was trained on data from a group of people and then tested on a person from outside of this group.
From the results of conducted experiments, an appropriate set of conclusions were drawn. It is possible to create a classifier on lower grade dataset. The best classifier made on the Mindwave dataset had a prediction accuracy of 89%. The classifier made on lower grade dataset presented worse results than the classifier made on high-grade dataset. The difference in prediction accuracy between both classifiers is 10\%. Classifiers tested on one set of people could not accurately predict the emotions of people outside of this group. The conclusions were consistent with related works results."

Several efforts have been devoted to utilizing the deep learning-based approach to tackle the pill recognition problem in the literature. However, due to the high similarity between pills' appearance, misrecognition often occurs, leaving pill recognition a challenge. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a novel approach named PIKA that leverages external knowledge to enhance pill recognition accuracy. Specifically, we address a practical scenario (which we call contextual pill recognition), aiming to identify pills in a picture of a patient's pill intake. Firstly, we propose a novel method for modeling the implicit association between pills in the presence of an external data source, in this case, prescriptions. Secondly, we present a walk-based graph embedding model that transforms from the graph space to vector space and extracts condensed relational features of the pills. Thirdly, a final framework is provided that leverages both image-based visual and graph-based relational features to accomplish the pill identification task. Within this framework, the visual representation of each pill is mapped to the graph embedding space, which is then used to execute \attention over the graph representation, resulting in a semantically-rich context vector that aids in the final classification. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use external prescription data to establish associations between medicines and to classify them using this aiding information. The architecture of PIKA is lightweight and has the flexibility to incorporate into any recognition backbones. The experimental results show that by leveraging the external knowledge graph, PIKA can improve the recognition accuracy from 4.8% to 34.1% in terms of F1-score, compared to baselines."

However, corn leaf disease poses a threat to corn farmers in increasing production. Farmers find it difficult to identify the type of corn leaf that is affected by the disease. Seeing the
development of corn that continues to increase, prevention of common corn leaf
disease needs to be prevented to increase production. By using open dataset, the
modern MLP-Mixer model is used to train the smaller size of datasets for further used in predicting the classification of diseases that attack corn leaves. For
the image classification problem in this experiment, the MLP-Mixer model is
used because it does not use the convolutional principle and uses the basic Multi Layer Perceptron which is repeatedly applied in feature channels. This makes
the MLP-Mixer model more resource efficient in carrying out the process to
classify corn leaf disease. In this research, a well-designed method ranging from
data preparation related to corn leaf disease images to pre-training and model
evaluation, the model we used resulted in a test accuracy of 96.79 %. This result
is certainly a new trend in image classification, so that it can be a solution in
handling computer vision problems in general. Furthermore, the results of this

It is difficult to know whether an agent that requires to communicate with us can be trusted or not before communication with it. We want to know whether the agent is trust or not to establish trustworthy and secure communication, e.g., public key infrastructure (PKI). Thus, we should calculate the degree of trust of the target agent by using already known fact, hypotheses, and observed data. Trust reasoning is a process to calculate the degree of trust of the target agents and messages that come from other agents. Although current extension of reciprocal logic is an expectable candidate for a logic system underlying trust reasoning but it has limitation when we deal with trust relationships between agents and messages from other agents. In the extension, messages that come from other agents are regarded as countable objects, and are represented as individual constant from the viewpoint of predicate logic. In a trust relationship between agent and message from other agent it is needed in communication, e.g, PKI to represent messages as a proposition. On the other hand, Demolombe represents message that comes from another agent as a proposition. From viewpoint of expressive power, Demolombe’s approach is better and current extension is not enough. Following the Demolombe's approach we introduced two modal operators and add several axioms to reciprocal logic and a case study of trust reasoning based on proposed extension in public key infrastructure (PKI) is also presented."

This paper deals with the selection of a method to classify software vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks and threats in the network. The classifier will be created based on the Naive Bayes method. However, the quality analysis of the classifier, i.e., checking whether it classifies vulnerabilities correctly, was performed by plotting the ROC curve and analyzing the Area Under the Curve (AUC)."

this context, a study of the requirements becomes necessary to overcome these problems of heterogeneity

In this paper, we propose a formal model to verify IoT components, as well as their requirements based
on LoRaWAN technology. To achieve so, we used Event-B to fomalize an IoT system and its desired

We design an indirect strategy that addresses effectively this issue. It lifts to the high resolution domain any existing attack that works in the CNN's input size domain.

Method: We used the Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm to cluster the dataset into clusters and then applied the IFPUG FPA method for effort estimation on these clusters. The ISBSG dataset was used in this study. The number of clusters is determined using the Elbow method with the Distortion score. Besides, the k-means algorithm was also used as the comparative algorithm. The baseline model was determined by using the FPA method on the entire dataset without clustering.
Result: With the number of clusters selected as 4, on six evaluation criteria, MAE, MAPE, RMSE, MBRE, and MIBRE, the experimental results show the estimated accuracy using the FPA method on clustered data significantly better when compared with no clustering. Conclusion: the software enhancement ef-fort estimation can be significantly improved when using the Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm."

In this paper, an integrated economic production quantity (EPQ) model that considers energy consumption is analyzed. The concept of specific energy consumption (SEC) is used to evaluate the energy consumption during the production time of the machine. The energy production cost is considered in two phases: production phase and non-production phase. Three types of SEC, depending on the production rate, were considered and analyzed. By minimizing the total cost, the condition of the machine in the non-production phase, the optimal production rate, the optimal cycle time and the influence of these different methods of measuring energy consumption are defined. The results of the study show that the difference in using the SEC -types model does not affect the state selection of the machine during the non-production phase, but can change the optimal solutions of the overall system. From the manager's point of view, the choice of different models to represent the energy consumption of the machine leads to different optimal decisions.

It helps the robot to analyze the customer's face effectively. However, the previous methods weakly recognize non-frontal faces. It is caused by the facial pose variations only to show partial facial features. This paper proposes a multi-view real-time facial emotion detector based on a lightweight convolutional neural network. It offers a four-stage backbone as an efficient feature extractor that discriminates specific facial components. The convolution with Cross Stage Partial (CSP) approach was employed to reduce computations from convolution operations. The attention module is inserted into the CSP block. These modules also support the detector to work speedily on edge devices. The classification system learns the information about facial features from the KDEF dataset. As a result, facial emotion recognition achieves comparative performance to other methods with an accuracy of 97.10\% on the KDEF, 73.95 on the FER-2013, and 84.91\% on the RAFDB dataset.

To manage the market in a decentralized and secure way, we propose V2GNet; a blockchain-based energy trading system on Vehicle-to-Grid network to enact a practical economic perspective. While consortium blockchain techniques are applied to handle the trading of EV fleets and distributed requests in a credible way, V2GNet consolidates campus control system of trading with energy exchanges to serve as a smart mediator."

The process of frequent subgraph mining is NP-complete because we need to test isomorphism subgraph, so methods based on frequent subgraph mining are ineffective. To address this limitation, in this work, we proposed novel graph classification via graph structure learning, which auto-matically learns hidden representations of substructures. Inspired by doc2vec, a successful and efficient model in Natural Language Processing, the graph em-bedding uses rooted subgraph and topological features to learn representations of graphs.

Especially, chronic diseases (non-communicable) such as diabetes, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases are the cause of more than 70% of death cases worldwide. Chronic diseases are considered as one of the direct reasons of hospital overload and poverty increase, putting high pressure on the economy and the society. That is why chronic diseases have become the first prioritized concern of the entire health industry. Therefore, the understanding of the progression of diseases in general and chronic diseases in particular is necessary for the disease predictions to be made, which provide important information useful for the planning and the preparation of resources to prevent and cure the diseases most effectively. Basing on the basic information of patients’ medical history, this research analyzes and builds the diseases network to exploit hidden information showing the disease relations and progressions. After that, machine learning models are applied into the analysis and exploitation of the diseases network in order the assess the risks of morbidity in the future. Specifically, this research predicts the risk of contracting cardiovascular diseases in patients with type-2 diabetes. The data used in this research includes 249,809 medical histories of 65,337 inpatients and outpatients in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The accuracies of the four prediction models (SVM, DT, RF and KNN) range from 78% to 80%. The predicted data from this research can be used promisingly as a reference for medical specialists to provide effective healthcare guidance to patients as well as for healthcare service providers to use their data effectively and enhance their service quality.

These works have leveraged state-of-the-art algorithms such as 2D and 3D convolutional neural networks in order to analyze and process video data. However, these models are computationally expensive which prevent their use at scale for low- resource devices. Moreover, previous works in literature have not considered modelling features for simple and complex actions given a video segment. This information is crucial when trying to identify actions for a given task. Hence, this work proposes an architecture called FASENet, a 1D convolutional neural network-based two-stream fall detection and activity monitoring model using squeeze-and-excitation networks. By using pose keypoints as inputs for the model instead of raw video frames, it is able to use 1D convolutions which is computationally cheaper than using 2D or 3D convolutions, thereby making the architecture more efficient. Furthermore, FASENet primarily has two streams to process pose segments, a compact and dilated stream which aims to extract features for simple and complex actions, respectively. Furthermore, squeeze-and-excitation networks are used in between these streams to recalibrate features after their combination based on their importance. The network was evaluated in three publicly available datasets, the Adhikari Dataset, the UP-Fall Dataset, and the UR-Fall Dataset. Through the experiments, FASENet was able to outperform prior state-of-the-art work on the Adhikari Dataset for accuracy, precision, and F1. The model was shown to have the best precision on the UP-Fall and UR-Fall Datasets. Finally, it was also observed that FASENet was able to reduce false positive rates compared to a previously related study."

The Hadoop cluster hosts multiple parallel workloads requiring various resource usage (CPU, RAM, etc.). In practice, in heterogeneous Hadoop environments, resource-intensive tasks may be allocated to the lower performing nodes, causing load imbalance between and within clusters and
and high data transfer cost. These weaknesses lead to performance deterioration of the Hadoop system and delays the completion of all submitted
jobs. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient and
dynamic load balancing policy in a heterogeneous Hadoop YARN cluster. This novel load balancing model is based on clustering nodes into subgroups of nodes similar in performance, and then allocating different jobs in these subgroups using a multi-criteria ranking. This policy ensures the most accurate match between resource demands and available resources in real time , which decreases the data transfer in the cluster. The experimental results show that the introduced approach allows reducing noticeably the completion time s by 45% and 12% compared with
the H-fair and a load balancing approach respectively. Thus, Hadoop can
rapidly release the resources for the next job which enhance the overall

Typically, interesting knowledge including outliers, are easier to find in low dimensional, interesting subspaces of the full feature space. Finding these subspaces is considered an NP-Hard problem and require careful attention especially in the context of data streams. To address these issues, we proposed BGSSA (Binary Gravitational Subspace Search Algorithm), a novel subspace search method used for outliers in high dimensional data streams.  For each streaming window, we adapt the binary GSA metaheuristic algorithm to find high contrast subspaces composed of independent attributes, where outlier detection will be performed.

As the most popular and readily available research tool in diagnosis, radiography is critical. Despite all of the benefits of this technology, diagnosing sickness symptoms from photos is a challenging task that necessitates the involvement of highly experienced specialists as well as significant time investment. The difficulty arises from the incompleteness and inaccuracy of the initial data, particularly the presence of numerous image distortions such as excessive exposure, the presence of foreign objects, and so on. The U-net technique was used to do early processing of CT images of the lungs using a neural network during the research. The current status of study in the field of X-ray and CT image identification employing in-depth training methodologies demonstrated that pathological process recognition is one of the most significant tasks of processing today."

Insect pest image classification",reject,yes,yes,"Insect pest assault is one of the most important concerns in agriculture, re-sulting in crop quality decline. Farmers, however, have a complicated and time-consuming task in detecting and categorizing insect pests. Therefore, research of an effective system for image-based automated insect pest classi-fication is crucial. The “softmax” function is utilized to determine the cate-gory for new image occurrences and minimise “cross-entropy” loss in the bulk of current research, which focuses on employing deep convolutional neural networks to categorize insect pest images. This paper presents a novel method for large-scale insect pest image classification by combining fine-tuning EfficientNets and Power Mean SVM. First, EfficientNet models are fine-tuned and re-trained on new insect pest image datasets. Image features are extracted from these datasets using the created network models. The ex-tracted features are then used to build a machine learning classifier. In the network's classification step, we substitute the traditional “softmax” func-tion with a non-linear classifier, Power Mean SVM. As a result, rather than “cross-entropy loss,” the training process focuses on reducing “margin-based loss.” Several benchmark insect pest image datasets were used to test our proposed method. According to the experiments, our method outperforms other cutting-edge algorithms for insect pest image categorization. Specifi-cally, the accuracy performance of the combination of fine-tuning Efficient-Nets and Power Mean SVM is 99% for the Xie24, 99% for the D0, and 72.31% for the large dataset IP102. To our knowledge, these are the best per-forming image classification results for these data sets."

seal as a legal solution necessary for the transition to a fully digital

document and confirm the data contained in a digital document.
A usage scenario of electronic seals – e.g. confirming financial operations,
issuing invoices, etc. – may require much harder security measures than
in the case of electronic signatures attributed to physical persons. Although
we are going to use cryptographic digital signature schemes for
both electronic signatures and electronic seals, in the case of electronic
seals the impact of a security breach might be greater by an order of
magnitude.
One of the critical issues is maintaining control over the set of seals created
by a device. The owner of the device must be sure that no seal has
been created without his consent. On the other hand, it should be impossible
to hide any seal created by the device, for example, for accounting
control purposes.
In this paper, we present effective solutions for chaining of digital signature.
When a list of electronic seals is presented, one can check whether
this is the list of all electronic seals created by a device over a given
period of time. We also provide means for clone detection.
Unlike the previous solution, the proposed schemes do not require sharing
any secret key with the seal creation device and the proof is not “onetime”
only."
